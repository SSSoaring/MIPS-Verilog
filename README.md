# MIPS-Verilog
 Implement a MIPS CPU in Vivado

* lab01: LED Flow Water Light
* lab02: 4-bit Adder
* lab03: MIPS ALU
* lab04: Register and memory
* lab05: A single cycle CPU with 16 instructions(add, sub, and, or, addi, andi, ori, slt, lw, sw, beq, j, jal, jr, sll, srl)
* lab06: CPU pipeline with stall, forwarding, predict-not-taken and 31 instructions  
Hope to help you design a more powerful pipeline CPU  
But please don't plagiarize!
